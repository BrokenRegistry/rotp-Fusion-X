This mod allows the use of several presets that may change all the settings, or only some...
You may have some preset that influences the galaxy size, shape and quality, while some other influences the races and their relations, then combines these presets.
 
Sequence:
- The Standard configuration file (Remnant.cfg) is loaded.
- The Extended presets file (Presets.cfg) is loaded and activated if ENABLE is either "Load" or "Both".
- The User may change the parameters with the standard interface
- When the "Start" button is activated, the presets file is updated if ENABLE is either "Save" or "Both"

The first setting is global to the file:

¦ SETTING	: ENABLE
# OPTIONS	: [No, Save, Load, Both]
# DEFAULT	: Both
# LAST	: 
ENABLE	: Both

No:	The mod is disabled
Save:	Only update the contents of the preset file, the preset are not loaded
Load:	Only load the presets, the file is not updated
Both:	Load the presets then update the file

Then the User's presets designation are listed with their actions. You just have to add a line to add a preset. All is case insensitive. The load order is given by this list.

¦ SETTING	: CONFIG ACTION
# OPTIONS	: [-, Load, Save, Update, Load and save, Load and update, Save default, Update to default]

Load	 : To Load these following presets (if not empty nor invalid)... The last one win!
Save	 : The following presets will be set to the last configuration.
Update	 : If not empty, the following presets will be set to the last configuration.
Default : The following presets will be set to the default configuration (the one before the presets file was loaded).

Then all the useful settings are listed.

The last one is not yet implemented... Be patient!
