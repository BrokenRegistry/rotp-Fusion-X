## Profiles Manager extended configuration file: Profiles.cfg

This mod allows to save and reuse user preferred configurations as profiles.<br>
Each profiles may affects all parameters or only some!<br>
Several partial profiles can be loaded together to be combined.<br>
For example, you may have some profiles that influences the galaxy size, shape and quality, while some other influences the races and their relations.<br>
There is an option to ask for a random parameter.<br>
Change may be done whwen loadin a game file.<br>
- And more... See User Manual.

  ### <u>Player Presets</u>
  
  The player may add as many profiles as necessary.<br>
  Each profiles is given a name. They are listed at the begining of the file and associated with an action.<br>
  Possible actions:<br>
  __Load:__ To Load the following profile (if not empty nor invalid)... The last one win! <br>
  __Savegui:__ The following profile will be set to the last in Gui configuration. <br>
